The Call of Cthulhu 

On the ocassion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's 
archeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics of the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which 
suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of 
the tablet implied kinship with anything but archeology. Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to 
make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, 
and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, "It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a 
dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon." 

It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of 
my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some 
years; and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great 
Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. 
Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a 
voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost 
unpronounceable jumble of letters: "Cthulhu fhtagn."
